## Database schema
![alt text](img/db_schema.png)

- Schema consists of 3 entity tables: users, wishlists and wishlist_items
- user_wishlist_association table is for many to many relation between users and wishlists

## Functional description
- User can log in via google account
- User can add wishlist 
- When logged in user fetches the all wishlists he gets only wishlists which belong to him
- User can share any wishlist which belongs to current logged in user with other user
- User can add wishlist_items to specific wishlist
- User can set is_reserved flag in any wishlist_item which will prevent this item from deleting

## Project structure

- Service backend runs with flask and flask-restx framework 
  * app.wishlist package defines all logic related to api
  * app.auth package handles google authentication and creation of users
- Wsgi application runs via gunicorn in docker container
- Docker container deployed on heroku
- Postgres database runs separately in heroku
